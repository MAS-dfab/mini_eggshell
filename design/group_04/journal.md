* Create column by simuletanous clay printing and concrete casting, with the structural goal of creating supports on the column for (horisontal) beams.
* Explore joint geometry, e.g. articulated joints (inspired by skeletal joints) or restrained joints.
* Exploration of clay overhangs while simultaneously casting.

End goal: 2 colums 1 beam
