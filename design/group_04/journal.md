Working on design propsal and goals.

* Create column by simultaneous clay printing and concrete casting, with the structural goal of creating supports on the column for (horisontal) beams.
* Explore joint geometry, e.g. articulated joints (inspired by skeletal joints) or restrained joints.
* Exploration of clay overhangs while simultaneously casting.

End goal: 2 colums 1 beam

### Challenges
* clay formwork: max overhang for the support of the beam. Add micro-structure to the faces of the beam 
* structural purpose: opitmize interface column and beam
